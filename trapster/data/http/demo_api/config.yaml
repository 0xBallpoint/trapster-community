# templates folder will be used to render the response using jinja2 templating
# templates correspond to 'endpoints' that you defined in the 'endpoints' section
# files folder will be used to serve static files

# headers here are optional, and will be added to all responses
headers:
  Server: nginx
  X-Powered-By: PHP/7.4.3

# endpoints are matched in order, and the first one that matches is used
endpoints:
  - "/":
    - method: GET
      status_code: 200
      file: index.html # serve the content of index.html

  - "/robots.txt":
    - method: GET
      status_code: 200
      # you can serve content from a file, or directly here as a string
      content: | 
        User-agent: *
        Disallow: /
      # you can also add headers to the response
      headers:
        Content-Type: text/plain

  - '/api/v1/settings':
    - method: POST # the status_code of the respond is dynamic and present in the jinja2 template
      file: settings.j2 # file use jinja2 templating to create dynamic content
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/json

  # you can use regex to match the path
  - '/api/v1/user\?id=([1-9]|10)([#&].*)?$': #match digits 1-10, optional # or ? at the end and any trailing query string
    - method: GET
      status_code: 200
      file: user.j2 # file use jinja2 templating to create dynamic content
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/json

  - "/api/v1/user\\?id=([0-9]+)('|%27)(.*)":
    - method: GET
      status_code: 200
      # you can use ai to generate the response
      ai:
        prompt: |
          You are a HTTP API server, using MySQL, vulnerable to a SQLi. To try to understand how SQLi works, you are given an attacker payload and will write the expected output of the MYSQL.
          Normal responses and errors are in JSON.
          Write the expected output if the attacker payload is "{{ path }}". If the MYSQL query would returns an error, write the error.
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/json

# if no endpoint matches, the default one is used
default:
  status_code: 404
  file: 404.html

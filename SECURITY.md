## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability in our system, we appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly.

Please submit all vulnerability reports through the "[Security](https://github.com/0xBallpoint/trapster-community/security)" tab of our GitHub repository using the "Report a vulnerability" feature. This ensures a secure and streamlined process for handling sensitive information.

If you're unable to use the GitHub security feature for any reason, you can alternatively contact us via email at: contact [at] ballpoint.fr.

## When Reporting a Vulnerability

- Status Updates: You will receive regular updates (at least every 7 business days) on the progress of our investigation and resolution.
- Resolution Timeline: We aim to resolve validated vulnerabilities as quickly as possible, depending on their complexity and severity.
- Disclosure: We kindly ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we've addressed it and coordinated a safe disclosure timeline with you.

### If the Vulnerability Is Accepted
We will notify you when the issue is resolved and provide information on the release or patch. With your consent, we may include your name or handle in our security acknowledgments.

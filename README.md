Trapster Community is a low-interaction honeypot designed to be deployed on internal networks or to capture credentials. It is built to monitor and detect suspicious activities, providing a deceptive layer to network security.

Visit the [Trapster website](https://trapster.cloud) to learn more about our commercial version, which includes advanced features like pre-configured hardened OS, automatic deployment, webhook, SIEM integration and much more...

## Features

- **Deceptive Security**: Mimics network services to lure and detect potential intruders.
- **Asynchronous Framework**: Utilizes Python's `asyncio` for efficient, non-blocking operations.
- **Configuration Management**: Easily configurable through `trapster.conf`.
- **Expandable Services**: Add and configure as many services as needed with minimal effort.
- **HTTP Honeypot Engine with AI capabilities**: Clone any website using YAML configuration, and use AI to generate responses to some HTTP requests.

## Logs

### Format
Each module can generate up to 4 types of logs: `connection`, `data`, `login`, and `query`.
* `connection`: Indicates that a connection has been made to the module.
* `data`: Represents raw data that has been sent, logged in HEX format. This data is unprocessed.
* `login`: Captures login attempts to the module. The data field is in JSON format and contains processed information.
* `query`: Logs data that has been processed and does not correspond to an authentication attempt. The data field is in JSON format and contains processed information.

You can then filter log type you don't need.

## HTTP Engine with AI capabilities

### Configuration
The HTTP module can emulate any website. It works with YAML configuration files to match requests using regular expressions, and can generate responses using either a template or an AI model.

The configuration are stored in [trapster/data/http](trapster/data/http), each folder represent a website.
An example of the functionnalities can be found at [trapster/data/http/demo_api/config.yaml](trapster/data/http/demo_api/config.yaml)

**Structure:**
- config.yaml: contains the configuration for the website.
- files/: contains the static files for the website.
- templates/: contains the templates for the website, it supports [jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) syntax.

### Example: Fortigate

The default HTTPS server shows a fortigate login page:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b351089-c7b9-471b-ac33-fcc79454e73c)

If someone tries to login, you will get a log like this one:
```json

   "device":"trapster-1",
   "logtype":"https.login",
   "dst_ip":"127.0.0.1",

      },
      "status_code":200,
      "username":"admin",
      "password":"admin"
   }
}
```

### AI ALPHA support
To generate responses, you can use the `ai` field in the configuration. For now, it uses [OVHCloud AI Endpoints](https://endpoints.ai.cloud.ovh.net/) as it is still free, and in beta.
The file `trapster/modules/libs/ai.py` contains the code to generate responses using the AI model. It is still very basic, and will be improved in the near future.

For example, this image show a request to capture SQLi attempts, and the response generated by the AI model.

Trapster Community is a low-interaction honeypot designed to be deployed on internal networks. It is built to monitor and detect suspicious activities, providing a deceptive layer to network security.

Visit the [Trapster website](https://trapster.cloud) to learn more about our commercial product, which includes advanced features like pre-configured hardened OS, automatic deployment, webhook, and SIEM integration.

## Features

- **Deceptive Security**: Mimics network services to lure and detect potential intruders.
- **Asynchronous Framework**: Utilizes Python's `asyncio` for efficient, non-blocking operations.
- **Configuration Management**: Easily configurable through `trapster.conf`.
- **Expandable Services**: Add and configure as many services as needed with minimal effort.

## Installation

To install Trapster, clone the repository and use `setup.py` to install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xBallpoint/trapster-community/
cd trapster
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

### Configuration
Trapster uses a configuration file located at `data/trapster.conf`. Ensure the configuration file is correctly set up before running the daemon.
You can add as many services as you want, even mutliple services of the same type.

You should also change the `interface` name, Trapster uses that to discover the IP address it should bind to. On linux, you can type `ifconfig` or `ip a`.

### Running the Daemon

After installation, to start the Trapster daemon, simply use the trapster command inside your folder:
```bash
trapster
```
In development mode, you can use the main script:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Log format

Each module can generates up to four types of logs: `connection`, `data`, `login`, and `query`.
* `connection`: Indicates that a connection has been made to the module.
* `data`: Represents raw data that has been sent, logged in HEX format. This data is unprocessed.
* `login`: Captures login attempts to the module. The data field is in JSON format and contains processed information.
* `query`: Logs data that has been processed and does not correspond to an authentication attempt. The data field is in JSON format and contains processed information.
